## 2. Preprocess data
To process the data, you must first type this 
` python preprocess_data.py `  
But you can skip this step and just use the reduced data I placed in the `/data/elect` directory

## 3. Train and evaluate the model
To run the training and see the behavior of the whole code before making any changes you should type :  
` python train_gan.py --dataset elect --model test `  
--dataset The name of the preprocessed data  
--model the position of the specific params.json file under the folder of "experiments".
